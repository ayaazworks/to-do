# 📝 MERN Stack To-Do App with Virtualization

A high-performance Task Management application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). 

This project goes beyond a standard To-Do app by implementing **Server-Side Pagination**, **Infinite Scrolling**, and **Windowing/Virtualization** to handle large datasets efficiently.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🔐 Authentication & Security
* **Multi-User Support:** Secure User Registration and Login.
* **Data Isolation:** Users can strictly access, edit, and delete *only* their own tasks.
* **JWT Authentication:** Protected routes using JSON Web Tokens.

### ⚡ High Performance Frontend
* **Infinite Scrolling:** Automatically fetches data as the user scrolls, reducing initial load time.
* **Virtualization:** Uses `react-virtuoso` to render only the visible DOM nodes. 
    * *Result:* The app remains buttery smooth even with 10,000+ tasks in the list.

### 🛠 Task Management
* **CRUD Operations:** Create, Read, Update, and Delete tasks.
* **Bulk Actions:** Select and delete multiple tasks simultaneously.
* **Optimistic UI Updates:** Interface updates immediately upon deletion for a snappy user experience.
